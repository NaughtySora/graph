### What else to implement
1. **All-Pairs Shortest Path**
- Floyd-Warshall - DP approach for dense graphs
- Johnsonâ€™s algorithm - sparse graphs with negative weights
2. **Advanced Graph Structures & Queries**
- Bridges & articulation points
- Biconnected components
- LCA (Lowest Common Ancestor) in trees
3. **Flow & Matching**
- Max-flow / Min-cut (Ford-Fulkerson, Edmonds-Karp)
- Bipartite graph matching (Hopcroft-Karp)
4. **Special Graph Problems**
- Eulerian paths / cycles
- Hamiltonian paths / cycles
- DAG longest paths
5. **Dynamic / Real-World Patterns**
- Incremental MST / dynamic shortest paths
- Dynamic connectivity with Union-Find
- Real-world graphs: routing, blockchain, social networks
